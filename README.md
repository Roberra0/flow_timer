**Rhythm + Flow** is a productivity timer with a structured focus method to help you lock in & stay productive. 
It uses the Pomodoro time management technique to keep you deeply focused without burning out. Work in 25min work sessions and recharge in between with 5min breaks. After four work sessions, enjoy a longer 15min break.

This rhythm of focused work and intentional rest helps you stay productive, refreshed, and in the zone. All session and break lengths are fully customizable.

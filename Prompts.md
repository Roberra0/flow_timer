## Prompt 1
I want to create a simple timer app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It counts down from 25 minutes and has a start button that turns into a stop button.
.  

## Getting the default + Start state right
## Prompt 2
Dont show the actual time until the start button is clicked. When the timer starts, it should change to say "Stop" and when the stop is clicked it should reset the timer to the initial state. 
  ### Issue
  The button now changes to "stop" on click, but timer still shows before Start is clicked. And when the stop button is clicked, it pauses the timer instead of resetting
  ### Issue
  The ready now doesnt disappear and no timer shows up. Still same error being thrown every second: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'textContent')

There will be two types of countdowns, a work and break one.
Add a label for this type. The initial first one should be called “Work”
it should be the default.
After the work timer completes, i want a 1 minute countdown to automatically start.
This is the break timer and the label should be updated to “Break” during this 1 min.
After the break timer completes, i want the work timer to automatically start, and so on


## Promt 3
When I click Start during the work timer, the stop button works properly. When i inter the break timer, the stop button doesnt work. It should work as it does when i click it during the work timer.
